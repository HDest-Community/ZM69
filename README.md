As demand for a powerful yet portable anti-materiel rifle rose, Volt answered with the ZM69 - a semi-automatic rifle based on the same platform as other successes such as the ZM66 and ZM7 Liberator. Chambered for the mighty .50 OMG round and feeding from a 10-round mag, the ZM69 is an excellent rifle for people who need to hunt game. Very large, murderous, demonic game. For a brief period of time, a variant that has a fully automatic fire mode was produced, but Volt quickly ended production due to these rifles having horrific jamming issues. If you can handle the recoil, though, one of those is excellent for making sure something is very dead.

In order to keep the gun relatively light without obliterating your shoulder, .50 OMG cartridge isn't as strong as some might expect. However, it's still more than enough to bowl over a human-sized target.
There is a reloading device built in to the stock, although it can only load one bullet at a time. Additionally, it uses 7.76 brass to make new bullets since after firing, the .50 brass is not particularly reusable.

In the field, this gun will occasionally replace the plasma rifle. The weapon slot is 8.

Protip: Being a gigantic hunk of metal flying at hundreds of meters per second, it takes a lot to stop one of these bullets. Line 'em up and knock 'em down.
