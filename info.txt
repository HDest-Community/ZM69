As demand for a powerful yet portable anti-materiel rifle rose, Volt answered with the ZM69:
A semi-automatic rifle based on the same platform as other successes such as the ZM66 and ZM7. 
Chambered for the mighty .50 OMG round and feeding from a 10-round box mag, the ZM69 
will... er, forcefully and repeatedly penetrate your foes ;)

In order to keep the gun relatively light without smashing your shoulder into oblivion, 
.50 OMG cartridge isn't as strong as some might expect. 
However, it's still more than enough to bowl over a human-sized target.

Protip: Being a gigantic hunk of metal flying at hundreds of meters per second, 
it takes a lot to stop one of these bullets. Line 'em up and knock 'em down.
